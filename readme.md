# Python Interface to MSAA+IAccessible2

This project builds on top of the work of Eitan Isaacson [pyia](https://github.com/eeejay/pyia) project to build a python library to expose Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and IAccessible2 interfaces for Windows Operating system.
This project extends the pyia project to support the IAccessible2 interfaces.
The purpose of the project is to support ARIA and HTML5 implementation of the accessibility mapping specifictions as part of the activities of the W3C WAI ARIA and HTML5 working groups.

## Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Install using pip
  
```text

```

* The `setup.py` file will try to register IAccessible2Proxy based on if python is 32-bit or 64-bit with Windows. If it fails, then you need to register it manually with administration privileges:

```text
regsvr32 IAccessible2Proxy64bit.dll

or

regsvr32 IAccessible2Proxy32bit.dll
```

## Examples

* test.py will display a list of information on the currenly open windows
* test-callback.py will list events related to document loads and focus changes
